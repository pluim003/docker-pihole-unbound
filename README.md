# Pi-Hole + Unbound in one Container

## Description

This Docker deployment runs both Pi-Hole and Unbound in a single container.

The base image for the container is the [official Pi-Hole container](https://hub.docker.com/r/pihole/pihole), with an extra build step added to install the Unbound resolver directly into to the container not using [instructions provided directly by the Pi-Hole team](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/unbound/) but by installing the latest available version of Unbound. It seems that using a package manager you will get an Unbound-version which is over 1 year old and might contain security-issues which have been solved in more recent versions.

## Usage

First create a `.env` file to substitute variables for your deployment.

### Pi-hole environment variables

> Vars and descriptions replicated from the [official pihole container](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/#environment-variables):

| Variable | Default | Value | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ----- | ---------- |
| `TZ` | UTC | `<Timezone>` | Set your [timezone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) to make sure logs rotate at local midnight instead of at UTC midnight.
| `WEBPASSWORD` | random | `<Admin password>` | http://pi.hole/admin password. Run `docker logs pihole \| grep random` to find your random pass.
| `WEB_PORT` | unset | `<PORT>`| **This will break the 'webpage blocked' functionality of Pi-hole** however it may help advanced setups like those running synology or `--net=host` docker argument.  This guide explains how to restore webpage blocked functionality using a linux router DNAT rule: [Alternative Synology installation method](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/alternative-synology-installation-method/5454?u=diginc)
| `FTLCONF_LOCAL_IPV4` | unset | `<Host's IP>` | Set to your server's LAN IP, used by web block modes and lighttpd bind address.
| `REV_SERVER` | `false` | `<"true"\|"false">` | Enable DNS conditional forwarding for device name resolution |
| `REV_SERVER_DOMAIN` | unset | Network Domain | If conditional forwarding is enabled, set the domain of the local network router |
| `REV_SERVER_TARGET` | unset | Router's IP | If conditional forwarding is enabled, set the IP of the local network router |
| `REV_SERVER_CIDR` | unset | Reverse DNS | If conditional forwarding is enabled, set the reverse DNS zone (e.g. `192.168.0.0/24`) |
| `WEBTHEME` | `default-light` | `<"default-dark"\|"default-darker"\|"default-light"\|"default-auto"\|"lcars">`| User interface theme to use.

Example `.env` file in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yaml` file:

```
FTLCONF_LOCAL_IPV4=192.168.1.10
TZ=America/Los_Angeles
WEBPASSWORD=QWERTY123456asdfASDF
WEB_PORT=8100
REV_SERVER=true
REV_SERVER_DOMAIN=local
REV_SERVER_TARGET=192.168.1.1
REV_SERVER_CIDR=192.168.0.0/16
HOSTNAME=pihole
DOMAIN_NAME=pihole.local
WEBTHEME=default-light
```

### Using Portainer stacks? 

#### Note: the text belows was written by Chris Crowe. I have no experience with this. I only use the docker-compose up-method

> 2022-3-11: I'm being told that the advice below is no longer true in Portainer. If you're using Portainer, first try it without removing the volumes declaration and see if it works.

Portainer stacks are a little weird and don't want you to declare your named volumes, so remove this block from the top of the `docker-compose.yaml` file before copy/pasting into Portainer's stack editor:

```yaml
volumes:
  etc_pihole-unbound:
  etc_pihole_dnsmasq-unbound:
```

### Running the stack

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

> If using Portainer, just paste the `docker-compose.yaml` contents into the stack config and add your *environment variables* directly in the UI.
